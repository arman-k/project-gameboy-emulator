//This is a comment.
//This is the opcode database (without prefix CB) for the Gameboy CPU (LR35902).
//The general format for every instruction is simply a list of key-value pairs and a newline following it:
//key: value
//key: value
//key: value
//..........
//(newline).
//valid keys are: opcode, operand, operand1, operand2, mnemonic, length, cycles and flags.
//using any other key is undefined.
//always place a colon and a space after the key.
//for opcodes, specify the value as hex: 0x34, 0xB3 etc.
//for mnemonics, if the instruction is invalid, put invalid as the value. No other keys for that instruction should be placed afterwards.
//if there is no operand, don't put any operand key at all.
//if there is only one operand, use either operand or operand1 as keys (don't use operand2)
//if there are two operands, use operand1 and operand2 as keys.
//for flags, specify them in this order: ZNHC (without spaces).
//using '-' in place of each flag means that flag is not affected by this instruction
//using '1' means, the flag is set by this instruction
//using '0' means, the flag is reset by this instruction
//using its corresponding letter means, the operation will determine the state of this flag.
//must place a newline after every instruction block.
//instructions with the CB prefix should be placed in the opcbdb.txt file.
//both these db files are used to generate repetitive code or strings by codegen.exe
//
//the instructions as updated here now should be correct.
//don't leave any space before the first instruction
